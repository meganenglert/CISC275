        Basic Definitions of HTML

        - Tags: Mark the start of an element, enclosed in angle brackets
        - Attributes: Hold additional pieces of information, placed inside the opening tag
        - head: Generally contains page metadata
            Inside the head tag, we find:
            - title: Holds the page name
            - meta: Holds the page's character encoding, name, and description
        - body: Contains the content of the page
    </body>
