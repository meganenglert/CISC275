## Installed VSCode, Node, and Typescript
I used [this tutorial](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/tutorials/week1-getting-started) to get it done. I also followed their instructions to make my first little [TypeScript program](https://github.com/meganenglert/CISC275/blob/master/hello-world.ts)!

*Reflection*: Other than a setting I had to change to be able to use TypeScript, this whole installation process went very smoothly. I really like VSCode! It's really intuitive in my opinion.

*Skills Practiced*: Visual Studio Code, TypeScript

## Added a kanban board to my portfolio repository

I was poking around on all of the tabs for my repository on GitHub and came across the `Projects` tab. I will use [this kanban board on my portfolio repository](https://github.com/meganenglert/CISC275/projects/1) to keep track of my TODOs. 

*Reflection*: This seems like a great built-in tool, especially for working in groups. It's really nice that it's within GitHub, rather than trying to have multiple websites to track.

*Skills Practiced*: Git

## Made my first website - "HTML Notes"

I found [html.com](https://html.com/) through Google and saw that they had a great page on some basic definitions and tags. My uncreative mind defaulted to using a [new HTML website](https://meganenglert.github.io/CISC275/first-website) to take notes on... HTML. I included an unordered list, a definition list, anchor tags, an image (a terrible picture of my guinea pig), a table, and some other tags that apply to text.

*Reflection*: Honestly, HTML is way easier than I thought it would be. It was a bit overwhelming to see all the tags used in class, especially with their different attributes, but I actually had the time to digest how the tags work. In writing this reflection, I also found it way easier to talk about my experience now that I know the "tag"/"attribute" terminology. It also took me a bit to figure out where the link to the webpage would actually be in GitHub Pages, so I learned a bit about that too!

*Skills Practiced*: Basics of the Web - HTML, Deploying with GitHub Pages

## WhatNow - the meat of this portfolio (hopefully)

This week, I was aggressively scouring the internet to find task management/organization software with all of the functionalities I wanted, when I realized I could probably make it myself. 

I wrote a detailed explanation of the purpose and planned features for this web app in markdown just to get all of my ideas on paper, and you can find that on [the GitHub pages link](https://meganenglert.github.io/WhatNow/) for my [WhatNow repository](https://github.com/meganenglert/WhatNow).

For the sake of this portfolio, here is a summary of the planned features:
- Basic features
    - User interface to add a task and assign its priority
    - Button to randomly select a task, weighted by priority
    - Checkbox to complete a task
- Reach features
    - Database storage to allow for restarting the page without losing everything
    - Custom user tag system for filtering tasks
    - Time field for each task that can be used for filtering or viewing the estimated time needed to complete all tasks in a tag
